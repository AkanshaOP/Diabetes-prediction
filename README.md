Project Title: Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning for Early Risk Assessment.

Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learningâ€“based predictive model for the early detection and risk assessment of diabetes. The primary goal is to enable timely intervention by identifying individuals at high risk before the onset of severe symptoms.

Using a dataset containing medical and lifestyle parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, age, and other relevant health indicators, the model is trained to classify patients as either at risk or not at risk of developing diabetes.

The workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features to ensure optimal model performance.

Model Training: Implementing algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification, with hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score (via classification_report) to measure model effectiveness.

Result Analysis: Comparing predicted outcomes with actual test data to assess real-world applicability.
